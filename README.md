# Chandler Lake Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website. Projects are listed in `projects.json` and displayed automatically on the home page.

To add a new project, edit `projects.json` and include an entry with a `title`, `description` and optional `link`.

After updating the file, push the changes to deploy the updated portfolio.
