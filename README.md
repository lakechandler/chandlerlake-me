# Chandler Lake Asset Aggregator

This repository contains my website as an asset aggregator. Assets are listed in
`projects.json` and displayed automatically on the home page.

To add a new asset, edit `projects.json` and include an entry with a `title` and
`description`.

After updating the file, push the changes to deploy the updated site.
